AKDL stays for **Another Keyword Definition Language**

Itâ€™s all about defining a syntax and generating java parser and runtime code.
If you define your syntax in a file named, for instance, _test.def_, run AKDL as follows:

_**java akdl.AKDLmain test.def**_

If you are not familiar with the way of defining your syntax in your .def file, please refer to the **Visual AKDL Editor** which will help you creating this .def file in a fully intuitive way.
